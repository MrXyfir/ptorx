    description: `Protect your privacy by keeping your real email addresses hidden behind Ptorx's proxy email addresses. Use a proxy email anywhere you'd use your normal email address and any incoming mail to your proxy email will be redirected to your real one. You can also send or reply to mail from your proxy emails. Companies, hackers, spammers, and anyone else who receives your proxy address will be unable to find your real address. Whenever you're done with a proxy email, simply delete it, and it will no longer be linked to you or your real email address.`,
