# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy details how your 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is used by Ptorx. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your PII in accordance with our website.

## Information Collection and Usage

When ordering, registering, linking services to your account, or at other times on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your email address or other details to help you with your experience. Your information is only stored by Ptorx when you make actions that would require Ptorx to do so. For example when creating an account, proxy email, or other digital items in our app.

We may use the information we collect from you when you register, make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:

- To personalize your experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested.
- To improve our website in order to better serve you.

Ptorx does not save any mail in part or full that is sent or received by our proxy emails unless the specific proxy email has the `Save Mail` feature enabled. When this feature is enabled, a full copy of every incoming email is stored for a month after it is received. Ptorx does not use the mail we store for any purposes other than to provide with the optional, requested features.

## Information Security

We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we use HTTPS while information is being transmitted, and all payment transactions are processed through gateway providers and are not stored or processed on our servers.

## Cookies

We use cookies as a required part of our authentication process that keep you logged in for your session.

## Third-Party Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your PII or uploaded data.

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

We do not allow third-party behavioral tracking.

## Do Not Track

We don't honor Do Not Track signals because:

- Minimal tracking is required for users to login and for our service to work properly.
- Minimal tracking data is only stored temporarily.
