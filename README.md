# Ptorx — Anonymous Mail

[Ptorx](https://ptorx.com) lets you send and receive email anonymously using [proxy emails](https://github.com/Xyfir/ptorx/blob/master/docs/help.md#terminology).

## What's a Proxy Email?

Proxy emails act as a middleman between your real email addresses and the rest of the world.

They're like an email alias or a forwarding address: any mail sent to one is redirected to the email addresses you configure. They _also_ allow for advanced features like filtering and modifying your incoming mail before it gets forwarded.

## Why Use Ptorx?

Strengthening your privacy and security is as simple as generating a new proxy email for each website you create an account on, and for each person you email. Keeping your addresses separate and unique for each use-case is an important part of staying protected when a site you use suffers a database breach, when an app you use sells your data, when spammer gets ahold of your email, or when a snoop starts trying to piece together your online activity.

Ptorx makes managing all those unique emails a breeze, and it works easily with whatever your current email setup is. Gmail? AOL? Your own installation of Roundcube? Whatever it is, we'll forward incoming mail to your real address so you can continue using the tools you're familiar with. You can even reply to received mail anonymously from your proxy emails right within your preferred mailbox provider.
