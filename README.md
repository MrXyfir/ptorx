## What's an Email Alias?

An email alias acts as a middleman between your real email addresses and the rest of the world.

Any mail sent to an alias is forwarded sto the email addresses you configure. They also allow for advanced features like filtering and modifying your incoming mail before it gets forwarded.

## Why Use Ptorx?

Strengthening your privacy and security is as simple as generating a new alias for each website you create an account on, and for each person you email. Keeping your addresses separate and unique for each use-case is an important part of staying protected when a site you use suffers a database
breach, when an app you use sells your data, when spammer gets ahold of your email, or when a snoop starts trying to piece together your online
activity.

Ptorx makes managing all those unique emails a breeze, and it works with whatever your current email setup is. Gmail? AOL? Your own installation of
Roundcube? Whatever it is, we'll forward incoming mail to your real address so you can continue using the tools you're familiar with. You can
even reply to received mail anonymously using your alias from right within your preferred mailbox provider.
